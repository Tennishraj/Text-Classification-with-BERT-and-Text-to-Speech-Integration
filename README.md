# Text-Classification-with-BERT-and-Text-to-Speech-Integration

Project Name: Text Classification with BERT and Text-to-Speech Integration
Project Overview:
This project involves building a text classification model using the BERT architecture from Hugging Face's Transformers library. The model is trained to classify questions into predefined categories, leveraging a dataset formatted in JSON. Additionally, it includes a text-to-speech feature that reads out the predicted classifications, enhancing user interaction.

Key Components:
Data Loading and Preprocessing:

JSON data is loaded and converted into a Pandas DataFrame.
A new column, 'text', is created from the 'question' field, and labels are mapped to numeric values for model training.
The label mapping is saved for later use in interpreting model predictions.
Dataset Preparation:

The dataset is split into training and evaluation sets (80% train, 20% eval).
The text data is tokenized using a pre-trained BERT tokenizer to prepare it for model input.
Model Training:

A BERT model configured for sequence classification is initialized.
Training arguments are set, including batch size, learning rate, and logging settings.
The model is trained using the Hugging Face Trainer API.
Model Evaluation:

After training, the model is evaluated on the test dataset, and results are printed.
Inference with Text-to-Speech:

The trained model is loaded for inference.
A function predicts the class labels for new text input.
The predictions are mapped back to their original labels, and results are spoken aloud using the pyttsx3 library.
Use Case:
This project can be used in applications requiring automated question-answering systems, customer support bots, or educational tools where users can ask questions and receive verbal responses based on the model's predictions.

Next Steps:
Testing: Further testing with diverse input examples to evaluate model performance.
Enhancements: Explore hyperparameter tuning, more complex datasets, or additional features like context-based responses.
Deployment: Consider deploying the model as a web service for broader accessibility.
